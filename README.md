These files are from the tutorial: 

[ðŸ”Œ **Installing and configuring NUT (Network UPS Tools) for your home lab**](https://sava.rocks/blog/installing-and-configuring-nut-network-ups-tools-for-your-home-lab/) and [**Use Gotify with NUT Server**](https://sava.rocks/blog/use-gotify-with-nut-server/)

which can be found on the following 3 protocols of Sava.Rocks which are **https://**, **gemini://** and **gopher://** :

[gemini://sava.rocks/](gemini://sava.rocks/)

[gopher://sava.rocks/](gopher://sava.rocks/)



The files in the folder **server** are meant to be on the connected device via USB cable to the UPS.

The files in the folder **client** are meant to be on all other connected devices to the same network that will query the server for the UPS status and also get notified of changes.
